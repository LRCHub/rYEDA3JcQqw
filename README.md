[00:04.78] There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:09.13] Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
[00:13.79] Finally I can see you crystal clear
[00:18.35] Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[00:44.35] 
[00:22.96] See how I'll leave with every piece of you
[00:27.21] Don't underestimate the things that I will do
[00:31.88] There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:36.67] Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
[01:04.67] 
[00:41.69] The scars of your love remind me of us
[00:46.41] They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
[00:51.30] The scars of your love they leave me breathless
[00:55.62] I can't help feeling
[01:05.62] 
[00:58.39] We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[01:01.76] (Never had met me)
[01:03.42] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[01:06.13] (Rolling in the deep)
[01:16.63] 
[01:07.85] You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[01:10.50] Of your hands (never had met me)
[01:12.61] And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
[01:14.94] To the beat (rolling in the deep)
[01:31.44] 
[01:17.80] Baby, I have no story to be told
[01:22.44] But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
[01:27.02] Think of me in the depths of your despair
[01:31.47] Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
[01:57.47] 
[01:36.31] (You're gonna wish you)
[01:37.63] The scars of your love (never had met me)
[01:39.92] Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)
[01:41.73] They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)
[01:43.91] That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[01:46.44] The scars of your love (never had met me)
[01:48.58] They leave me breathless (tears are gonna fall)
[01:50.70] I can't help feeling (rolling in the deep)
[02:11.70] 
[01:52.98] We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[01:56.78] (Never had met me)
[01:58.15] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[02:00.94] (Rolling in the deep)
[02:11.44] 
[02:02.69] You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[02:05.24] Of your hands (never had met me)
[02:07.41] And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
[02:09.69] To the beat (rolling in the deep)
[02:26.19] 
[02:11.66] We could've had it all
[02:15.72] Rolling in the deep
[02:20.32] You had my heart inside of your hand
[02:24.94] But you played it with a beating
[02:40.94] 
[02:31.08] Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
[02:35.24] Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
[02:39.88] Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
[02:44.64] You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
[03:11.64] 
[02:49.84] (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[02:52.69] We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[02:56.99] We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:02.15] It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:35.15] 
[03:06.34] We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[03:10.21] (Never had met me)
[03:11.43] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[03:14.36] (Rolling in the deep)
[03:24.86] 
[03:15.65] You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[03:18.45] Of your hands (never had met me)
[03:20.30] And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
[03:22.76] To the beat (rolling in the deep)
[03:39.26] 
[03:24.90] Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[03:28.09] (Never had met me)
[03:29.26] Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[03:32.48] (Rolling in the deep)
[03:42.98] 
[03:33.77] You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[03:36.62] Of your hands (never had met me)
[03:38.62] But you played it, you played it, you played it
